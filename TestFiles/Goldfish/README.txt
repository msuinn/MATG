Simple attempt at a more robust version of face detection. Focuses on a single detected face. Helps prevent shorterm occlusions from disrupting the tracking.  Helps filter out the false postives. Does introduce some lag to initial detection and tracking speed is limited.  Outputs the spherical coordinates of a detected face in space
